I am your career counsellor
========================================
Very frequently my colleagues, friends, job seekers even relatives are asking me a very common questions given below..

* How easy to learn python?
* How long will it take to learn Python?
* Can I learn python in a month?
* Can a beginner learn Python?
* Can I learn Python without any programming experience?
* Will learning Python get me a job?

Most learners take at least three months to complete this path. To be clear, though, you could probably spend a lifetime learning Python. 
There are hundreds of libraries, many of them regularly improving and evolving, and the language itself also changes over time.

The language is easy to pick up, but you need to do more than just learn the basics; to get a job, 
you need to have a strong understanding of some pretty complex processes. Python is a general-purpose language, 
which means it isn't used for just one purpose such as Web development.
