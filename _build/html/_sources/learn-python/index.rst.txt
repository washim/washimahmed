=========================
Python Getting Started
=========================
Lets start with python learnings and good luck.

Installation
===============
You can install python from here https://www.python.org/downloads/

Hello World
===============
Create helloworld.py file with below program.

.. code:: python
   
   print("Hello, World!")

run helloworld.py in terminal like below

.. code:: shell

   C:/Users/Your Name>python helloworld.py

.. note::

   **C:/Users/Your Name** this will be the actual root folder for your helloworld.py based on the operating system you are using.

Python Comments
=================
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them.

.. code:: python

   #This is a comment
   print("Hello, World!")

Python Variables
=================
Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

.. code:: python

   x = 5
   y = "John"
   print(x)
   print(y)

.. code:: python
   
   x = 4       # x is of type int
   x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
   print(x)

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

.. code:: python
   
   x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
   y = int(3)    # y will be 3
   z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

.. code:: python

   x = 5
   y = "John"
   print(type(x))
   print(type(y))

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

.. code:: python

   x = "John"
   # is the same as
   x = 'John'

Variable names are case-sensitive.

.. code:: python

   a = 4
   A = "Sally"
   #A will not overwrite a

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Legal variable names:

.. code:: python

   myvar = "John"
   my_var = "John"
   _my_var = "John"
   myVar = "John"
   MYVAR = "John"
   myvar2 = "John"

Illegal variable names:

.. code:: python
   
   2myvar = "John"
   my-var = "John"
   my var = "John"

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter called **Camel Case**

.. code:: python
   
   myVariableName = "John"

Each word starts with a capital letter called **Pascal Case**

.. code:: python
   
   MyVariableName = "John"

Each word is separated by an underscore character called **Snake Case**

.. code:: python

   my_variable_name = "John"
