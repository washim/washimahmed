=========================
Python Getting Started
=========================
Lets start with python learnings and good luck.

Installation
===============
You can install python from here https://www.python.org/downloads/

Hello World
===============
Create helloworld.py file with below program.

.. code:: python
   
   print("Hello, World!")

run helloworld.py in terminal like below

.. code:: shell

   C:/Users/Your Name>python helloworld.py

.. note::

   **C:/Users/Your Name** this will be the actual root folder for your helloworld.py based on the operating system you are using.

Python Comments
=================
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them.

.. code:: python

   #This is a comment
   print("Hello, World!")

Python Variables
=================
Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

.. code:: python

   x = 5
   y = "John"
   print(x)
   print(y)

.. code:: python
   
   x = 4       # x is of type int
   x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
   print(x)

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

.. code:: python
   
   x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
   y = int(3)    # y will be 3
   z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

.. code:: python

   x = 5
   y = "John"
   print(type(x))
   print(type(y))

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

.. code:: python

   x = "John"
   # is the same as
   x = 'John'

Variable names are case-sensitive.

.. code:: python

   a = 4
   A = "Sally"
   #A will not overwrite a
