Preface
=========
I start writing this technical blog to help myself to identify things quickly and in the same time it helps python practitioners, like you, get on top of python/data expert, fast. 
In this technical platform I used python as a programming language in most of the case.

A Better Way
==============
This technical blog was born out of my frustrations at seeing practitioner after practitioner diving into python textbooks and online courses designed for undergraduate students and giving up.
The bottom-up approach is hard, especially if you already have a full time job.  Python is not only important to machine learning, but it is also a lot of fun, or can be if it is 
approached in the right way. I put together this blog to help you see the field the way I see it:  as just another set of tools we can harness on our journey toward 
python learning.
